- Log-in to [https://api.system-id.com/](https://api.system-id.com/)
Log-in to [https://api.system-id.com/](https://api.system-id.com/).
The homepage shows you different service plans that you can use for your webapp. Each plan consists in bunch of user profile information required by your application.
SystemId will always ask the end user for permission to disclose those piece of information to you.
Click on **Service accounts** on the left panel.
And click the red `+` button on the bottom right corner to add a new Service account.
Fill in the required fields:
 - Name
 - Service type
(Other fields are for further use.)
Then save!


- Web application registered in the platform receives
1. a unique code ex: `precious-cargo-2564` (this is just an example. your actual code will be different)
Now click on the edit(pencil) button on the right of your new webapp, and wait for the **Keys Management** tab to show up. (it may take up to one minute).
2. This file conatins a private (and secret) apikey to connect to the system-id api at [https://api.system-id.com](https://api.system-id.com)
Make sure you save it in a very secure place.

### Secured Login
- Web app server generates a pseudo-random unique tokenId ex: `f5338d36-23e9-4080-af6f-4acda8529815`
- this uuid is the text code of a QRCode shown in the log-in page
- In the meantime, the sends a request so systemID can uniquely identify your QRcode UUID.

- The form if this Http request is:
  - url : [https://api.system-id.com/api/token/your-client-id](https://api.system-id.com/api/token/your-clinet-id)
  - method: `POST`
  - request body:
      - type: `login`
      - uuid: `<the UUID generated by webapp`
      - regid: `Firebase Cloud Messaging registration token` (optional)

> Note: replace 'your-client-id' with your company's client-id. 
> You can find this ID in the config file downloaded at registration time.
 

- A check button is provided on the login page to generate a server based check at http://api.system-id/com/users/authenticate?tokenId=<tokenId>
- This button can be omitted if you provide a `regid`  along with your token registration request. in this case SystemID will send a FCM (firebase cloud messaging) message to this regid. 
- in case of authorized connection, the the link above returns a JWT token that can be decoded to receive basic user information.
