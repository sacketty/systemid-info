Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nAs a GitHub Pages remote theme\n\n\n  Add gem \"jekyll-remote-theme\" to your Gemfile to add the theme as a dependancy\n  Run the command bundle install in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy\n  Add jekyll-remote-theme to the list of plugins in your _config.yml file\n  Add remote_theme: daviddarnes/alembic to your _config.yml file to set the site theme\n  Run bundle exec jekyll serve to build and serve your site\n  Done! Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nAs a Boilerplate / Fork\n\n(deprecated, not recommended)\n\n\n  Fork the repo\n  Replace the Gemfile with one stating all the gems used in your project\n  Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: .github, LICENSE, screenshot.png, CNAME and alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec\n  Run the command bundle install in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy\n  Run bundle exec jekyll serve to build and serve your site\n  Done! Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nCustomising\n\nWhen using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, simply by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.\n\nTo add your own styles copy the styles.scss into your own project with the same file path (assets/styles.scss). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the @import \"alembic\"; line.\n\nIf you‚Äôre just looking to set your own colours and fonts copy the _settings.scss file into your project at the same file path (_sass/_settings.scss) and change variables however you wish. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from Sassline - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.\n",
